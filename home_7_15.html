	<h1 style="text-align:center">List of countries and dependencies by population</h1>
	<p class="paraOne">This is a list of countries and dependent territories by population with inclusion within the list being based on the ISO standard ISO 3166-1. This does not reflect the countries who report significantly different populations of citizens domestically and overall. Some countries, notably Thailand, do not report total population, exclusively counting citizens, for total populations an international agency must issue an estimate.
	</p>
	<p id="paraTwo">
	The list includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states. The United Kingdom is considered (as a sovereign state) as a single entity in the lists while the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands are regarded separately.
